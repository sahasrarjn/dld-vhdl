# Lab 1 - AND, OR, NOT Gates

## DLD-Team

### VHDL files

- andGate : Entity and Architecture for AND gate
- orGate : Entity and Architecture for OR gate
- notGate : Entity and Architecture for NOT gate
- main : Entity and Architecture for main file



### Testbench files

- Testbench : For combined architecture (main) 
- testbench_and : For AND gate
- testbench_or : For OR gate
- testbench_not : For NOT gate



###  Usage and summary 

We have tried to implement modular code. We first created separate entities and tested them with corresponding testbenches. After obtaining the results, with an modular idea we finally combined all chips and defined a main architecture to use all the gates in a single chip, and tested it with a corresponding testbench.
